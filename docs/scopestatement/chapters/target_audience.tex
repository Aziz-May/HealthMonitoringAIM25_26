The Smart Health Monitoring System is intended for two main groups:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Healthcare professionals:} Doctors, nurses, and caregivers who require continuous access 
    to accurate patient health data in order to provide timely diagnoses, interventions, and follow-up care. 

    \item \textbf{Families with elderly members:} Individuals who want to ensure the safety and wellbeing 
    of older relatives at home by monitoring their vital signs remotely and receiving immediate alerts 
    in case of falls or health emergencies.
\end{itemize}

By addressing both professional and personal needs, the system provides a reliable solution 
for continuous health monitoring and emergency response.
